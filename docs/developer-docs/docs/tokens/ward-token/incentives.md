# Incentives

The Warden Protocol will distribute WARD to stakeholders to incentivize behaviors that add value to the Warden ecosystem.

Incentive programs include the following:

1. **Ecosystem & Community Incentives:** These incentives will be used to grow the ecosystem and further the long-term interests of the protocol.

2. **Developer Incentives:** These incentives are for developers building and deploying applications on Warden. Additionally, an Activity Mining Program will be launched rewarding applications that reach certain milestones (e.g. total value locked, monthly active users), and their users.

3. **R&D Programs:** Where the Warden Protocol would benefit from additional core functionality, or integrations, Warden will commission work to developer teams to contribute to the core execution layers of the protocol.
