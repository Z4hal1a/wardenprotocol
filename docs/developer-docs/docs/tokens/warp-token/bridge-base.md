# Bridge to Base

## Overview

**WARP tokens** are available on the Base chain's decentralized exchanges (DEXes) as [WARP-USDC](https://www.dextools.io/app/en/base/pair-explorer/0xf523d578816e1b537d8d69500d44d0c699b5d9a9?t=1714815531823). 

This section explains how to acquire WARP on Base using Squid Router powered by Axelar.

## 1. Get ETH

First, you should get some ETH for future transitions on Base. Base fees are very low, so you don't need to bridge a big amount of ETH in USDC value.

1. Go to https://app.squidrouter.com/.
2. In **FROM** select the chain which you want to bridge / swap from, and the token you want to use (note: depending on if you use a Cosmos Chain - such as ATOM or Osmosis, or an EVM chain, such as Ethereum or Optimism, you'll be able to connect either Keplr Wallet or MetaMask as your origin wallet).
3. In **TO** select the chain to which you want to bridge / swap to (here **select Base**) and the token you want to use (here **select ETH**).

## 2. Get USDC

Then you should get some USDC for the WARP-USDC trading pair:

1. Go to https://app.squidrouter.com/.
2. In **FROM** select the chain which you want to bridge / swap from, and the token you want to use (note: depending on if you use a Cosmos Chain - such as ATOM or Osmosis, or an EVM chain, such as Ethereum or Optimism, you'll be able to connect either Keplr Wallet or MetaMask as your origin wallet).
3. In **TO** select the chain to which you want to bridge / swap to (here **select Base**) and the token you want to use (here **select USDC**).
