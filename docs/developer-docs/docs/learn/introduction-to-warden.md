# Introduction to Warden

## The Warden Protocol

The **Warden Protocol** is a modular L1 blockchain enabling developers to deploy [Omnichain Applications (OApps)](/learn/glossary#omnichain-application) with [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com). You can also participate by operating a [Keychain](/learn/glossary#keychain) or running a [node](/learn/glossary#warden-protocol-node) and becoming a [validator](/learn/glossary#validator).

OApps are a powerful evolution of traditional smart contracts. They allow signing transactions at any chain, while traditional smart contract applications only target users of a single chain. An example of an OApp is [SpaceWard](/learn/glossary#spaceward) – our application functioning as the front-end interface for Warden.

We're currently implementing a breaking update to the protocol. OApp developers will be able to build and integrate [AI-driven Agents](/learn/glossary#agent) – autonomous trainable programs independently managing complex processes. You can find more information here: [Glossary: Coming soon](/learn/glossary#coming-soon).

## Key protocol features

- **Dynamic smart contracts**  
Utilize a next-generation CosmWasm smart contract layer capable of autonomous logic execution to ship truly decentralized applications with a flexible development suite powered by Rust.

- **Novel Web3 modules**  
Access the premier plug-and-play Web3 modules to rapidly iterate a diverse array of groundbreaking dApps.

- **Unprecedented interoperability**  
Ship dApps with native access to all popular assets, bridges, oracles, and wallets. Warden is one of the most interoperable protocols available with connections to leading blockchains such as Ethereum and Cosmos while also being IBC-enabled.

- **Highly secure**  
Deploy on a Tendermint-based PoS network secured by a globally distributed group of renowned validators and trusted by leading institutions worldwide.

- **Coming Soon: Tailored for AI**  
Leverage the only layer one protocol optimized for building DeFi apps that can reach the next billion users in Web3. Put Intents and the evolution of intents using AI here.

## Why joining Warden?

The main advantage of Warden is [modular architecture](#modular-architecture). The protocol distinguishes between the application- and protocol-level security, taking the best from monolithic and isolated security systems and reducing the risks of both.

## Key protocol features

Key features of the Warden Protocol include the following:

- **Modular Security**  
Thanks to Warden's modular architecture, the same Omnichain Application can combine application- and protocol-level security models. This approach allows Warden to take the best from monolithic and isolated security systems and reduce the risks of both. To learn more, see [Modular architecture](#modular-architecture). 

- **Chain Abstraction**  
Instead of managing multiple wallets or accounts for different blockchains, you can aggregate them in one [Space](/learn/glossary#space) within the Warden Protocol. Omnichain Applications allow signing transactions and messages at any destination chain.

- **Omnichain Interoperability**  
It refers to the possibility of communication between different blockchain networks. While most interoperability providers focus on particular ecosystems, Warden's goal is connecting different ecosystems. Omnichain Applications not only provide cross-chain swapping and [bridging](/learn/glossary#bridging) but also are able to exchange information with each other. This allows overcoming the fragmentation of the blockchain landscape.

## Modular architecture

The Warden Protocol's architecture is based on several independent [modules](https://warden-docs-git-docs-test-qrdo-foundation.vercel.app/learn/warden-protocol-modules/introduction). This allows finding a middle ground between two main approaches to security in Web3 applications:

- **Monolithic systems** impose equal security on their applications. A vulnerability on a monolithic protocol may affect several applications, leaving developers and users with no means of protection.

- **Isolated security** allows developers to define security configurations separately for each application. Users have to validate the risk of each application, relying on developers as trusted third parties.

Warden offers a third approach:

- **Modular Security** is based on distinguishing between the application- and protocol-level security. Developers can deploy the same OApp with different security models, combining monolithic protocol security with isolated application security:

    - **Application-level security:** OApp users can set and manage their own application security settings with the help of [Approval Rules](/learn/glossary#approval-rule) and [Keychains](/learn/glossary#keychain). Warden's [Modular Key Management](/learn/glossary#keychain) enables users to choose third parties they can trust.

    - **Protocol-level security:** Each OApp is collectively secured by all the tokens [staked](/learn/glossary#staking) on the protocol. All OApps share the same protocol security, which isn't fragmented when the number of applications scales up. In addition, developers are able to implement new security technologies.

This diagram demonstrates the difference between the monolithic and modular architectures:
