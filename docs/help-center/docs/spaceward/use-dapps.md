# Use dApps

Within SpaceWard, you can access **decentralized applications** (**dApps**) across various blockchains. These applications streamline and centralize your decentralized finance activities for simplicity and convenience. 

You can connect to any EVM dApp through WalletConnect: 👉  [Use WalletConnect](use-walletconnect)

Alternatively, access a **SpaceWard-curated collection** of dApps:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org). If it's your first time, see the [Quick start guide](buenavista-quick-start).
2. In the left menu, navigate to **Apps**.

:::note
As the testnet phase advances, we plan to enhance connectivity with Cosmos chains. Cosmos wallets will gain the ability to interact directly once they are fully integrated with the Warden Protocol. We anticipate to achieve this goal in the months leading up to the mainnet launch.
