# Use WalletConnect

Within SpaceWard, you can access **decentralized applications** (**dApps**) across various blockchains. These applications streamline and centralize your decentralized finance activities for simplicity and convenience.

You can use dApps from a SpaceWard-curated collection: 👉 [Use dApps](use-dapps)

Alternatively, connect to any **external EVM dApp** through **WalletConnect**:

1. In the external app you're using, find a section for connecting wallets. Select **WalletConnect**.

2. Copy the pairing code or save the QR code as an image.

8. If you click **Approve**, the transaction will be sent to the Intent Engine of the Warden Protocol. This may lead to a signature request in your Cosmos wallet or initiate a different process based on the used Intent.

9. Once approved, the transaction will be signed by the preferred Keychain and broadcast to the destination blockchain.
