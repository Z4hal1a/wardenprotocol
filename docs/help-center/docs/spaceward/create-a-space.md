# Create a Space

A **Space** functions as a management hub for a collection of keys, akin to an organization.

You can maintain separate Spaces for distinct purposes, such as distinguishing between personal and professional uses.

When you first [connect your wallet](connect-your-wallet) to SpaceWard, a Space is created automatically. To create additional Spaces, do the following:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org). If it's your first time, see the [Quick start guide](buenavista-quick-start).

2. In the top-left corner of the page, Click **Active Space**.

3. Click **Create New Space**. This will make your Cosmos wallet execute a transaction that creates a new Space.

4. After the blockchain confirms the transaction, your new Space will be available for use.
