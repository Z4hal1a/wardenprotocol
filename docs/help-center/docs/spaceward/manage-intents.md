# Manage Intents

**Intents** are a set of user-defined conditions under which a Keychain signs a transaction with a private key.

SpaceWard users can set up their own Intents as conditions to get transactions approved. For example, an Intent can allow executing a transaction only if 2 of 3 approvers sign it.

To create an Intent, do this:

1. Connect to [SpaceWard](https://spaceward.buenavista.wardenprotocol.org). If it's your first time, see the [Quick start guide](buenavista-quick-start).

2. In the left menu, navigate to **Intents**.

3. Click **Create a new Intent**.

4. Select the preferred Intent type:

    - **Joint approval:** All approvers must approve the transaction.
    - **Approval by certain amount:** It's required to reach a minimum threshold – for example, 2 out of 3 approvers.
    - **Approval by anyone:** A single approval is required.

5. Depending on the selected Intent type, you may need to introduce additional accounts (approvers) that will participate in the Intent.
